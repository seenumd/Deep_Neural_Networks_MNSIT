# Deep_Neural_Networks_MNSIT
### Agenda:
1. Deep Neural Networks
2. MNIST data
	- Collect data with one_hot
	- Get train and test data
3. Define Parameters
	- Logging path
	- Strating Learning Rate
	- Features and classes
	- Batch size and Training epochs
	- Neurons in hidden layers
4. Build the Graph
	- Define placeholders and Vriables for all layers
	- Prediction
	- Loss
	- Optimizer
	- Model Accuracy
	- Logging
5. Execute the Graph
	- Create Sesson
	- Run session on training set
	- Run session on Test set
	- Log the loss and accuracy for train and test
	- Save the model
	- Close the session
